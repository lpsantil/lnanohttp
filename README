This is another _really_ minimal ISO C90-ish http server for linux:
 - single-threaded (1 connection = 1 request)
 - source configured (look for the configuration section in the code)
 - epoll-ed
 - signalfd-ed (i.e. synchronous)
 - direct syscalls (no libc)

Only HEAD and GET methods.

To map a content-type to a file "A", add a file "A.mime" containing the
content-type.
**BIG FAT WARNING** vim editor will add a spurious 0x0a '/n' line feed at the
end of the mime file.

Will chroot in the configured path once started.

Don't forget you need to give root priviledges to the server in order to listen
on port 80.

Look in ulinux/patterns/network_server if you want to ramp up this server with
cloning, etc.

I want a generic ELF data table builder.
I'm stuck with the ISO C99 data table builder.
