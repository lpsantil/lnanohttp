This is another _really_ minimal ISO C90-ish http server for linux:
 - single-threaded (1 connection = 1 request)
 - source configured (look for the configuration section in the code)
 - epoll-ed
 - signalfd-ed (i.e. synchronous)
 - direct syscalls (no libc)

Only HEAD and GET methods.

To map a content-type to a file "A", add a file "A.mime" containing the
content-type.

Will chroot in the configured path once started.

Don't forget you need to give root priviledges to the server in order to listen
on port 80.

Look in ulinux/patterns/network_server if you want to ramp up this server with
cloning, etc.

I want a generic ELF data table builder.
I'm stuck with the ISO C99 data table builder.
