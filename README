This is another _really_ minimal ISO C90-ish http server for linux:
 - single-threaded (1 connection = 1 request)
 - source configured (look for the configuration section in the code)
 - epoll-ed
 - signalfd-ed (i.e. synchronous)
 - direct syscalls (no libc)

Only HEAD and GET methods.

To map a content-type to a file "A", add a file "A.mime" containing the
content-type.  You don't need to add a charset to utf-8 xml target since the
http default iso8859-1 allows the browser to parse the xml first element were
utf-8 encoding will be defined.

Will chroot in the configured path once started.

Don't forget you need to give root priviledges to the server in order to listen
on port 80.

Look in ulinux/patterns/network_server if you want to ramp up this server with
cloning, etc.

I want a generic ELF data table builder.
I'm stuck with the ISO C99 data table builder.
